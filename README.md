Plus, with [Bing Maps](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/bing-maps/choose-your-bing-maps-api) integration, navigating to event locations is a breeze.

## Installation

Since the app is built in a docker container, you need to take a few steps before running it:

- Install Docker on your computer. You can find the installation instructions for your operating system here: https://docs.docker.com/get-started/

- Install Docker Compose. You can find the installation instructions for your operating system here: https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/

- Clone the GroupUp repository from GitLab:
```bash
git clone https://practice.grabit.io/zoran.trpcheski/groupup.git
```

- Change the directory into the GroupUp directory:
```bash
cd groupup
```

- Run the following command to build the container:
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

- Check the ID of the php container:
```bash
docker ps
```

- Open the php container terminal where instead of the PHP_CONTAINER_ID you will write the container ID that you got from the previous command:
```bash
docker exec -it PHP_CONTAINER_ID sh
```

- Run the following command inside the container:
```bash
composer install
```

- Now, you need to construct the data tables used in the app. Run the SQL migration scripts found in the groupup folder in the repository.

- You are now set to enjoy GroupUp.

*if you are on a MAC computer, you probably need to change the database image inside the docker-compose.yml from mariadb:latest to mysql:latest.
